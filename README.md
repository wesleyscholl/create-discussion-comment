"comment":{
    "id":"DC_kwdje64ife75s9o",
    "body":"This is a test comment from a GitHub action"

## Obtaining the `discussion-id`

You can find your `discussion-id` and using [GitHub's GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer). Replace `<REPO_NAME>` and `<REPO_OWNER>` to find the discussion id you wish to comment on.
### GraphQL Query
```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "<REPO_OWNER>`", name: "cohere") {
    discussions(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          # The value below is the discussion-id
          id
          title
          category {
            id
            name
          }
          body
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "repository": {
      "discussions": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              // This is the discussion-id  
              "id": "D_kwdje64ife75s9o",
              "title": "Test Topic Title - Insert Question Here",
              "category": {
